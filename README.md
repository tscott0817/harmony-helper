# Musical Chord Translator
This started as a small personal project to help me (a guitarist) with doing covers of songs
that were originally played on piano. I wanted to be able to easily translate the chords to
my primary instrument and decided to expand upon it to help other instrumentalists. You can
use this program to move your ideas between different instruments.
